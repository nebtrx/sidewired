Sidewired
=========

What is it?
-----------

A **MEF Plugin** with a **fluent configuration API** which allow you to drop the whole media content experience of **Silverlight Media Platform Player Framework (SMPPF)** into an **ASP.NET MVC Application** without having to create your own **Customized Silverlight Player**.
In other words you may use Silverlight Smooth Streaming Player or Silverlight Preogressive Download Player, both shipped by Microsoft, and use Sidewired to *sidewire* the playlist, chapters, timeline markers, ads, captions and other stuff to enhance the end user experience.
